### SECTION B (60 Marks)

(Answer any four questions from this Section.)

**Question 3**

Define a class with the following specifications:

- **Class name:** `Employee`
- **Member variables:**
  - `name` – name of the employee
  - `id` – ID of the employee
  - `salary` – salary of the employee

  (Declare the variables using appropriate data types)

- **Member methods:**

  - `void input()` – Accept name, id, and salary using methods of the Scanner class.
  - `void bonus()` – Calculate bonus based on the following criteria:
    - `salary > 50000` -> bonus is 20% of salary
    - `salary > 30000 and <= 50000` -> bonus is 15% of salary
    - `salary <= 30000` -> bonus is 10% of salary

  - `void display()` – Display employee name, id, salary, and bonus.

Call all the above methods in the main method using an object.

**Question 4**

Define a class to accept 5 integers from a user. Using selection sort technique, arrange them in descending order. Display the sorted array and the original array.

[15]

---

**Question 5**

Define a class to overload the function `calculate` as follows:

- `void calculate(int n)` - Print the

 factorial of `n`.
- `void calculate(int a, int b)` - Print the GCD of `a` and `b`.

[15]

---

**Question 6**

Define a class to accept a string and print the number of vowels, consonants, and spaces in the string.

Example: `S = “HELLO WORLD"`

Output: 
- Number of vowels – 3
- Number of consonants – 7
- Number of spaces – 1

[15]

---

**Question 7**

Define a class to accept values into an array of float data type of size 15. Accept a float value from the user and search in the array using the binary search method. If the value is found, display the message “Found” with its position where it is present in the array. Otherwise, display the message “Not found”.

[15]

---

**Question 8**

Define a class to accept values in an integer array of size 12. Find the product of even numbers and the sum of odd numbers entered. Display them separately.

Example: Input: `a[] = {2, 5, 4, 9, 8, 15, 3, 12, 6, 7, 11, 20}`

Output:
- Product of even numbers: \(2 \times 4 \times 8 \times 12 \times 6 \times 20\)
- Sum of odd numbers: \(5 + 9 + 15 + 3 + 7 + 11\)
